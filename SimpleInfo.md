# DischargeTool
Small tool for helping with battery discharge testing

This is a small assistant tool that Ive created for work for helping with discharge testing a string of batteries.

for the basic mode, you can specify the loadbank to use and the ETV voltage and it will state the lowest achievable load current.

the loadbanks are user created and can be created/edited/deleted and saved in a user .bin file locally.
battery block types can also be created/edited/deleted and saved in a user .bin file locally.

these two combined means that there can be a sort of more indepth analasys of the test to be conducted.
the user can specify an string of X ammount of user selectable block types, selecting the loadbank to use, then entering the desired
load current for the test to be performed.

doing this will give more information, like what the lowest voltage would be where the desired load current is no longer achievable.
therefore also stating how many blocks could be linked out of circuit before load no longer achievable.

just makes things a little easier than getting the calculator out each time I want to see if a test setting is viable or not.
